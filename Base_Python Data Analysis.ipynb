    "Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",

    "Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n",

    "List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.\n",

    "**Ordered**\n",
    "When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.**\n",
    "\n",
    "__Changeable__\n",
    "The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.\n",
    "\n",

    "Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:\n",

    "There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:\n",

    "**Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.\n",

    "**Dictionary** is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.\n",
